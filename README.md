# URL_Classification_AI_Model
-This is a AI model implemented in Python that determines whether a URL is malicious or benign using the K-Nearest-Neighbors supervised machine learning algorithm. A 400 row dataset is used to train the model. The libraries needed are indicated by the import statements at the top of each of the two files.

-The dataset I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aksingh2411/dataset-of-malicious-and-benign-webpages/data, even though mine is a much smaller version of this same dataset file.
